# Working with Atlas in Claude Code

## What is already prepared

Claude Code automatically loads the root `CLAUDE.md`. That file imports the
shared agent rules, current project handoff and product constitution so Codex
and Claude work from the same repository-owned source of truth.

Personal authentication and machine-specific settings must remain outside the
repository. Never store an Anthropic API key in this project.

## Windows prerequisites

Claude Code supports Windows through WSL or Git for Windows. This repository is
already a normal Git working tree and can be opened directly from its root.

After installing Claude Code and authenticating, verify the installation:

```powershell
claude --version
claude doctor
```

If native Windows cannot locate Git Bash, configure the standard Git for
Windows path for the current PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

## Open the project

In PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\marcu\OneDrive\Documents\Atlas Investimentos\Atlas_Investment_OS"
claude
```

Claude Code should load `CLAUDE.md` automatically. Use `/memory` inside Claude
Code to confirm the project memory files that were loaded.

## Safe first prompt

```text
Read CLAUDE.md and its imported project documents. Do not change files yet.
Verify git status, the v1.2.0 baseline and the full test gate. Then summarize
the architecture, current capabilities, governed financial configuration and
the next bounded backlog task.
```

## Parallel work with Codex

Do not let both tools edit the same branch and working directory at the same
time. Use one of these operating modes:

1. Sequential work: finish, test and commit in one tool before opening the
   next tool.
2. Parallel work: give each tool a separate Git worktree and branch.

Before switching tools, always run:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log -3 --oneline
```

Commit only one logical objective at a time. Fetch and compare histories before
integrating work. Never solve divergence with a force push.

## Project validation

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q --cov=. --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

The operational command is:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_all.py
```

The operational command accesses configured market data and writes ignored
runtime artifacts under `data/`, `logs/` and `output/`.
